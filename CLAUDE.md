# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for Claude.ai and Claude Code for working with Vercel deployments. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend Claude's capabilities.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `vercel-deploy`, `log-monitor`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app", "Check logs", etc.}
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief description of what the skill does.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

## Usage

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```

**Arguments:**
- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how Claude should format results when presenting to users}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}
```

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `/mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
```

### End-User Installation

Document these two installation methods for users:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r skills/{skill-name} ~/.claude/skills/
```

**claude.ai:**
Add the skill to project knowledge or paste SKILL.md contents into the conversation.

If the skill requires network access, instruct users to add required domains at `claude.ai/admin-settings/capabilities`.
